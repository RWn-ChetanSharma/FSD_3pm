# OOPs Programming

> OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.


# What are the 4 basics of OOP in C++?

> It revolves around the four basic principles of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. 


# Encapsulation

> Encapsulation is a concept used in object-oriented programming to bundle data and methods into easy-to-use units.

> Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.

# Abstraction

> Abstraction in OOPS is used to hide unnecessary information and display only necessary information to the users interacting. It is essential to represent real-world objects in a simplified manner for users to interact easily.

# Inheritance

> Inheritance is the concept in OOPs in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.


# Polymorphism 

> Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in OOP. It describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form. The different forms arise because these entities can be assigned different meanings and used in various ways in multiple contexts.
